This repository contains the source code for our paper **Synthetic Data for Brain-Computer Interfaces: Generation, Evaluation, and Applications**.

## Framework
Data generation driven machine learning pipeline for BCIs, which includes brain signal acquisition, data preprocessing, data generation, feature engineering, and classification/regression. The latter two components can be unified into a single end-to- end neural network. In this framework, data generation approaches for BCIs are categorized into four types: (a) knowledge-based generation, (b) feature-based generation, (c) model-based generation, and (d) translation-based generation. These four types can be integrated within a cohesive framework.
